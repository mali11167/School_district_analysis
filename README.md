# Overview 
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students data shows evidence of academic discrepancy specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School  for ninth graders appear to have been altered. This analysis requires us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once the changes are applied to math and reading scores, we would repeat the school district analysis and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
